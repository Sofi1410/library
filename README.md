# library
This is a tutorial project made by me during my first work as a trainee in SnowConsulting.
The main idea was to practice VueJS with Nuxt in order to apply later in a real project,
I hope you can use it to learn about the use of props and VueJS, is a very usefull tool.
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
